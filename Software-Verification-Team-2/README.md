## Course Description:
  Testing is a critical phase of the Software Development Life Cycle. When taking this course,
students work in teams to analyze the application under test (an accounting cloud-based
application), plan testing, produce test designs and test cases, execute testing and report
software defects. Students complete a major Testing Project Report clearly defining the
contribution of each student, present the project in the class, and upload the project
deliverables to the CS631G GitHub site for public evaluation/comments for improvement.

  Students will learn the importance of a systematic approach to software testing, and other
related technical and professional skills of software testers. A working knowledge of an object-
oriented analysis and design is recommended. A prior experience with software development in
the role of a business analyst, developer, tester, or project manager is a plus.

  The course design includes two parts â€“ a) lectures and b) testing seminars. Prior to testing
seminars, students will have an exam to demonstrate that they have sufficient knowledge to
start a testing project. Students will work on their projects in teams and produce scheduled
deliverables.

## Project 

  Students in the class will be working in project teams to analyze the application under
test (an accounting cloud-based application), produce test documentation, execute testing and
report software bugs. Project teams will include four project roles, related to testing and
common in the IT industry. Each student in a given team will be assigned a particular project
role and will be responsible for the related deliverables. The course will conclude with
submitting for assessment final deliverables and a project presentation that will be graded.

In GitHub, each testing module will have a corresponding folder where deliverables will be stored. 
| Folder Name  | Deliverables |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Requirements  | Functional Decomposition Diagram, Data Flow Diagram, Context Diagram, RCT, User Stories with Acceptance Criteria |
| Test Planning  | Test Plan Document, Testing RoadMap  |
| Test Design  | Test Design Documents (with Test Cases)  |
| Test Execution   | Test Execution Logs, Test Summary Report, qTest Insights, Test Execution report, Test Coverage Document, Burndown Chart, Defect Report (Jira) |
| Final Presentation  | Final Project Presentation, Recorded App Demo  |
